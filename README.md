# linked-list

This was our second paired project at Turing. The focus was jQuery. The object was to create a program that allows users to enter a title and the url for a bookmark they want to save. The site had to be responsive as well as incorporate buttons that allow users to chage the status or remove bookmarks. The time to complete the project was two days.
